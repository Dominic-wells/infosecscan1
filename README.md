A simple port scanner app built for members of infosec.live to learn the basics of Python programming 

Please note, scan only with permission and follow the law in your country. For example, in the UK,
where I am from Computer Misuse Act 1990 (CMA): The CMA makes it an offence to gain unauthorized
access to computer systems. Port scanning could be considered unauthorized access if performed without 
the system owner's consent or a legitimate reason.
